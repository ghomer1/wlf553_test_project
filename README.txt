This is a repository created by Garret Homer to organize and store data collected by the FISh 415/535 Limnology class at the University of Idaho. Spring Valley Reservoir, located east of Troy, Idaho, has been routinely sampled by the University of Idaho's Limnology lab on an annual basis since 2007. Sampling is performed by undergraduate and graduate students with minimal prior experience in the field of limnology, under the supervision of Dr. Frank Wilhelm. The samples are then analyzed using standard EPA approved methodology by the same students. This dataset consists of physical profiles, light profiles, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and macroinvertebrates collected in the late summer period each year, typically between August 21 and September 9th. These data offer an opportunity to analyze long term changes in lake behavior and chemistry, as well as the effectiveness of using inexperienced students or, alternatively, citizen scientists, in a lake monitoring program.
